Effective substitute for back squats in any program","The box squat allows you to squat to desired depth and develop explosive strength in the squat movement. Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.
Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.
With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.

In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.
As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.
Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.
The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.
Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.
At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position.",9.3
one-arm-kettlebell-push-press,Single-arm kettlebell push-press,Shoulders,Kettlebells,"The single-arm kettlebell push-press is a popular kettlebell movement that involves performing a press with help from the muscles of the lower body. It is preceded by a clean at the start of each set, and optionally you can perform a clean between each rep. It can be trained in traditional strength or muscle-building rep ranges, in circuit or fat-loss training, or as part of a larger kettlebell combination or complex.","Momentum from the legs powers the weight through the toughest part of the press
Allows you to press more weight than a strict military press
Full-body training that challenges the lower body as well as the shoulders, arms, back, and core
Cleaning the kettlebells to the rack position trains the hips, core, and back muscles","Hold a kettlebell by the handle. Clean the kettlebell to your shoulder by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebell towards your shoulder. Rotate your wrist as you do so, so that the palm faces forward. This will be your starting position.
Dip your body by bending the knees, keeping your torso upright.
Immediately reverse direction, driving through the heels, in essence jumping to create momentum. As you do so, press the kettlebell overhead to lockout by extending the arms, using your body's momentum to move the weight. Lower the weight to perform the next repetition.",9.3
push-press,Push-press,Quadriceps,Barbell,"The push-press is an overhead press variation in which the barbell is pushed upward with assistance from the lower body. This ""push"" helps the weight travel through the sticking point of a strict press. The push-press is commonly performed as part of barbell complexes, power training for all types of athletics, or as a powerful shoulder exercise.","Builds full-body power, strength, and coordination
Allows you to put heavier weight overhead than with a strict press
Works for low reps and moderate to high reps
Great full-body move with a shoulder emphasis","Use the floor-to-shoulder lifting technique described in the Power Clean exercise to move the bar from the floor to the shoulders.
Slightly flex the hips and knees, keeping torso erect.
Immediately follow with an explosive push upward by extending the knees.
Keep torso erect and tensed.
At maximum hip and knee extension, shift body weight to balls of feet and extend ankle joints.

suspended-fallout,Suspended ab fall-out,Abdominals,Other,"The suspended ab fall-out is a dynamic abdominal exercise utilizing a suspension strap system or gymnastic rings. It is similar in form to an ab roller, but can more easily be scaled to be more or less difficult. It targets the muscles of the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles, as well as the deep core muscles. It can be trained for low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle definition.","Intense training of multiple core muscles
Difficulty level can easily be changed by raising or lowering the straps
Also works muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi) and shoulders","Adjust the straps so the handles are at an appropriate height, below waist level.
Begin standing and grasping the handles. Lean into the straps, moving to an incline push-up position. This will be your starting position.
Keeping your arms straight, lean further into the suspension straps, bringing your body closer to the ground, allowing your shoulders to extend, raising your arms up and over your head.
Maintain a neutral spine and keep the rest of your body straight, your shoulders being the only joints allowed to move.
Pause during the peak contraction, and then return to the starting position.",9.3
standing-military-press,Military press,Shoulders,Barbell,"The military press is a compound movement used to build size and strength in the shoulders. It was once contested as a fourth powerlift, but is rarely competed anymore. However, being able to press a significant weight overhead remains a popular marker of upper-body strength. The military press can be trained as a strength lift or in traditional muscle-building rep ranges as part of full-body, shoulder-focused, or upper-body training.","Serious shoulder builder and overall strength measurement
Builds upper-body strength for other movements
Encourages healthy shoulder mobility
Triceps, core, upper back, and legs help move and stabilize the barbell","Start by placing a barbell that is about chest high on a squat rack. Once you have selected the weights, grab the barbell using a pronated (palms facing forward) grip. Make sure to grip the bar wider than shoulder width apart from each other.
Slightly bend the knees and place the barbell on your collar bone. Lift the barbell up keeping it lying on your chest. Take a step back and position your feet shoulder width apart from each other.
Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position.
Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.
Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
This exercise can also be performed sitting as those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety.
The behind the neck variation is not recommended for people with shoulder problems as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.
Another option is to use dumbbells when performing this exercise for better isolation.",9.3
snatch,Power snatch-,Quadriceps,Barbell,"The power snatch is a full-body lift in which the bar is pulled from the floor with a wide grip to the overhead position in one movement. The bar is received in the ""power"" position, with the hips higher than a full-depth squat position. The power snatch can be used as a learning tool for the full snatch, or to train muscular power and strength on its own. It is usually performed for low reps, focusing on power and movement quality.","Trains speed, strength, and power for athletic performance
Demands and develops overhead strength and stability in the shoulders and upper back
Great progression for the full snatch
Excellent strength and power work even with light weights","Place your feet at a shoulder width stance with the barbell resting right above the connection between the toes and the rest of the foot.
With a palms facing down grip, bend at the knees and keeping the back flat grab the bar using a wider than shoulder width grip. Bring the hips down and make sure that your body drops as if you were going to sit on a chair. This will be your starting position.
Start pushing the floor as if it were a moving platform with your feet and simultaneously start lifting the barbell keeping it close to your legs.
As the bar reaches the middle of your thighs, push the floor with your legs and lift your body to a complete extension in an explosive motion.
Lift your shoulders back in a shrugging movement as you bring the bar up while lifting your elbows out to the side and keeping them above the bar for as long as possible.
Now in a very quick but powerful motion, you have to get your body under the barbell when it has reached a high enough point where it can be controlled and drop while locking your arms and holding the barbell overhead as you assume a squat position.
Finalize the movement by rising up out of the squat position to finish the lift. At the end of the lift both feet should be on line and the arms fully extended holding the barbell overhead.",9.3
sumo-deadlift,Sumo deadlift,Hamstrings,Barbell,"The sumo deadlift is a compound movement in which the feet are set in a wide stance with toes pointed out and grip is placed inside of the legs. It is allowed to be performed instead of conventional deadlifts in most powerlifting competitions. The sumo deadlift targets the hamstrings, glutes, and upper back/traps, but also has a greater emphasis on stretching and strengthening the adductor and hip muscles due to the wide stance.","Builds overall strength, power, and size
Many find it easier on the lower back than the conventional deadlift
Strengthens the hips and requires a greater degree of mobility
Same full-body strength benefits as conventional deadlift","Begin with a bar loaded on the ground. Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip. Relax the shoulders, which in effect lengthens your arms.
Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees.
As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together.
Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down.",9.3
hang-clean,Hang Clean,Quadriceps,Barbell,,,"Begin with a shoulder width, double overhand or hook grip, with the bar hanging at the mid thigh position. Your back should be straight and inclined slightly forward.
Begin by aggressively extending through the hips, knees and ankles, driving the weight upward. As you do so, shrug your shoulders towards your ears.
As full extension is achieved, transition into the final pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.3.  Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.",9.3
dumbbell-v-sit-cross-jab,Dumbbell V-Sit Cross Jab,Abdominals,Dumbbell,"The dumbbell V-sit cross jab is a hybrid movement that trains the abdominal and shoulder muscles simultaneously. It can address multiple muscle groups in a time-efficient muscle-building or circuit-style workout, while also providing a cardiovascular challenge.","Strengthens the core to stabilize while the upper body is moving
Great shoulder pump, even with light weights
Excellent cardiovascular and conditioning challenge","Begin seated on your butt with your knees bent and feet on the ground. Lean your upper body back to form a 45-degree angle with the floor. Bring your feet off the ground so that your body resembles a ""V"" shape.
Grasp a dumbbell in each hand and hold tight to your chest with palms facing each other. This will be your starting position.
While keeping your core tight and maintaining your body's ""V"" position, quickly extend your left arm straight out (similar to a jab) and then bring it back to the starting position while simultaneously punching out with the right arm.
Your torso and legs may slightly rotate side to side opposite of your hands throughout the movementâ€”this is okay.
A punch with each hand counts as one total repetition. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.",9.3
reverse-band-box-squat,Reverse Band Box Squat,Quadriceps,,,,"Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Set up the bands either on band pegs or attached to the top of the rack, ensuring they will be directly above the bar during the squat. Attach the other end to the bar.
Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.
With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.
Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe. Use care to return the barbell to the rack.",9.3
standing-palms-in-dumbbell-press,Standing palms-in shoulder press,Shoulders,Dumbbell,"The standing palms-in shoulder press is a dumbbell exercise targeting the shoulders. It can be performed in strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning.","The standing position encourages core strength and a neutral lower back position

standing-cable-lift,Standing cable low-to-high twist,Abdominals,Cable,"The standing cable low-to-high twist is a core exercise targeting the upper abdominals and the obliques. Take care to perform it with control, as opposed to violent twisting which can injure the back. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-15 per side, as part of the core-focused portion of a workout.","Builds core strength and muscle control
Also works the shoulders, arms, back, and lower body
The cables provide constant tension on the muscles","Connect a standard handle on a tower, and move the cable to the lowest pulley position.
With your side to the cable, grab the handle with one hand and step away from the tower. You should be approximately armâ€™s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable. Your outstretched arm should be aligned with the cable.
With your feet positioned shoulder width apart, squat down and grab the handle with both hands. Your arms should still be fully extended.
In one motion, pull the handle up and across your body until your arms are in a fully-extended position above your head.
Keep your back straight and your arms close to your body as you pivot your back foot and straighten your legs to get a full range of motion.

decline-ez-bar-triceps-extension,Decline EZ-bar skullcrusher,Triceps,E-Z Curl Bar,"The decline EZ-bar skullcrusher is a popular exercise targeting the triceps muscles. The angle of the bench creates a greater range of motion than flat bench skullcrushers, as well as targeting the lateral head of the muscle. This exercise is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.","Builds bigger and stronger triceps
The EZ-bar is easier on the wrists than a straight bar
Great stretch and activation on all three triceps heads, particularly the lateral head","Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench.
Using a close grip (a grip that is slightly less than shoulder width), lift the EZ bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked and elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack.
As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary, bring the bar down slowly by moving your forearms in a semicircular motion towards you until you feel the bar slightly touch your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.

It is generally performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-15 reps per set, and can work as isolated forearm training or as part of an arms-focused workout.","Isolates the forearms, forcing them to work alone
Great sport-specific exercise for climbers and arm wrestlers
Develops greater forearm size and finger strength","Start by standing straight and holding a barbell behind your glutes at arm's length while using a pronated grip (palms will be facing back away from the glutes) and having your hands shoulder width apart from each other.
You should be looking straight forward while your feet are shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position.
While exhaling, slowly elevate the barbell up by curling your wrist in a semi-circular motion towards the ceiling. Note: Your wrist should be the only body part moving for this exercise.
Hold the contraction for a second and lower the barbell back down to the starting position while inhaling.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
When finished, lower the barbell down to the squat rack or the floor by bending the knees. Tip: It is easiest to either pick it up from a squat rack or have a partner hand it to you.",9.3
finger-curls,Seated finger curl,Forearms,Barbell,"The seated finger curl is an exercise targeting the muscles of the hands and forearms. It is popular with rock climbers and other athletes looking to build forearm size and strength. The range of motion is tiny, but done for moderate to high reps, these will definitely make the forearms burn.","Great for building forearm size and strength
Also works the wrists directly
Great for burnout sets at the end of an arm workout­­­­­­­­","Hold a barbell with both hands and your palms facing up; hands spaced about shoulder width.
Place your feet flat on the floor, at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position.
Lower the bar as far as possible by extending the fingers. Allowing the bar to roll down the hands, catch the bar with the final joint in the fingers.
Now curl bar up as high as possible by closing your hands while exhaling. Hold the contraction at the top.",9.3
wide-grip-standing-barbell-curl,Wide-grip barbell curl,Biceps,Barbell,"The wide-grip barbell curl is a variation of the classic barbell curl with the grip wider than shoulder width. It is thought that this helps build the inner or ""short"" head of the biceps muscles. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set.","Builds bigger and stronger biceps
Allows you to use more weight than a narrow grip does
Places the primary stress on the short (inner) head of the biceps","Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at the wide outer handle. The palm of your hands should be facing forward. The elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position.
While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move.
Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard.
Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
You can also perform this movement using an E-Z bar or E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.
You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.",9.3
spell-caster,Dumbbell spell caster,Abdominals,Dumbbell,"The dumbbell spell caster is an exercise that primarily targets the abdominal muscles such as the obliques. However, it also works shoulders, back, hips, and legs, and demands all of those muscles work together in a coordinated motion. It is usually performed with relatively light weights for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per side. Make sure to only use a weight you can control.","Strengthens the core, including the obliques
Challenges and activates the upper back muscles
Full-body strength and coordination challenge, even with light weights","Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated grip. Your feet should be wide with your hips and knees extended. This will be your starting position.
Begin the movement by pulling both of the dumbbells to one side next to your hip, rotating your torso.

Continue alternating, rotating from one side to the other until the set is complete.",9.3
dumbbell-floor-press,Dumbbell floor press,Triceps,Dumbbell,"The dumbbell floor press is a multijoint pressing exercise performed lying on the floor. It can be performed either with the knees bent or flat. The floor press limits the range of motion you would achieve with a regular dumbbell bench press, but still targets the chest, triceps, and anterior delts. This allows you to press more weight than in a dumbbell bench press, and perhaps put less stress on the shoulders.","Pressing from the floor with a neutral grip can take the stress off the shoulder joint
Can overload and focus on building triceps strength and bench press lockout strength
Takes your legs out of the movement, giving all the responsibility to your core and upper body
Builds chest and triceps size and strength","Lay on the floor holding dumbbells in your hands. Your knees can be bent. Begin with the weights fully extended above you.
Lower the weights until your upper arm comes in contact with the floor. You can tuck your elbows to emphasize triceps size and strength, or to focus on your chest angle your arms to the side.
Pause at the bottom, and then bring the weight together at the top by extending through the elbows.",9.3
lying-face-down-plate-neck-resistance,Lying Face Down Plate Neck Resistance,Neck,Other,,,"Lie face down with your whole body straight on a flat bench while holding a weight plate behind your head.

pullups,Pullups,Lats,Body Only,"The pull-up is a multi-joint bodyweight exercise that builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core. It is often used as a measurement tool in military or tactical fitness tests, and is an excellent gauge of “relative strength” which is strength in relation to bodyweight.","Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, upper back, core, and grip
Requires no equipment other than a bar
Can build absolute strength for low reps, or strength endurance for higher reps
Easy to alter grip style and width to target different muscles or rep ranges","Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.
Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.
Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.
On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.
The behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.",9.2
decline-reverse-crunch,Decline reverse crunch,Abdominals,Other,"The decline reverse crunch is a popular bodyweight exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the lower abs. It is usually performed for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of the ab-focused portion of a workout.","The decline angle increases difficulty
Great ab burnout move
Pairs well with other ab movements in a circuit
Can be progressed over time by increasing the decline or adding weight","Lie on your back on a decline bench and hold on to the top of the bench with both hands. Don't let your body slip down from this position.
Hold your legs parallel to the floor using your abs to hold them there while keeping your knees and feet together. Tip: Your legs should be fully extended with a slight bend on the knee. This will be your starting position.

One side can’t compensate for the other, as in the barbell bench press","Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.
Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.
Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.
Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.

seated-barbell-military-press,Seated barbell shoulder press,Shoulders,Barbell,"The seated barbell shoulder press is a classic exercise for building muscle and strength in the shoulders. The triceps also play a significant role in pressing the barbell overhead. Performing the movement seated reduces help from the lower body and decreases the risk of overextending the lumbar spine during the movement. This press variation can be the primary pressing movement on an upper-body or shoulder day, or an effective accessory movement later in a workout.","Builds shoulder muscle and strength
Seated position enforces strict form
Less risk of tweaking the lower back than with a standing press","Sit on a Military Press Bench with a bar behind your head and either have a spotter give you the bar (better on the rotator cuff this way) or pick it up yourself carefully with a pronated grip (palms facing forward). Tip: Your grip should be wider than shoulder width and it should create a 90-degree angle between the forearm and the upper arm as the barbell goes down.
Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position.
Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.
Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
This exercise can also be performed standing but those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety.

It targets nearly all of the muscles in the back, but particularly the lats, rhomboids, and lower back. It is thought to target the biceps and lats a bit more directly than overhand barbell rows. Because it can be loaded heavily, it is a popular movement in strength and muscle-focused upper-body workouts.","Reverse grip requires more work from the biceps and targets the lats
Strengthens the lats, rhomboids, spinal erectors, hamstrings, and glutes
Teaches proper ab bracing and maintains positioning of the spine","Stand erect while holding a barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up).
Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up.

Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad, leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction.
With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.
Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back.
Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.

It primarily targets the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles, but also strengthens the deep core muscles. It is most commonly performed early in an ab workout, usually in moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or higher.","Great way to load abs with weight that can be tracked and increased over time
Greater range of motion than a traditional sit-up or crunch
Weighted ab training can increase core definition in addition to strength","Kneel below a high pulley that contains a rope attachment.
Grasp cable rope attachment and lower the rope until your hands are placed next to your face.
Flex your hips slightly and allow the weight to hyperextend the lower back. This will be your starting position.
With the hips stationary, flex the waist as you contract the abs so that the elbows travel towards the middle of the thighs. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and hold the contraction for a second.
Slowly return to the starting position as you inhale. Tip: Make sure that you keep constant tension on the abs throughout the movement. Also, do not choose a weight so heavy that the lower back handles the brunt of the work.

hanging-leg-raise,Hanging leg raise,Abdominals,Body Only,"The hanging leg raise is an exercise targeting the abs, but which also works the lats and hip flexors. Instead of resting your forearms on the pads of a captain's chair, you perform these hanging from a bar. Experienced lifters make these look easy, but beginners may need time to build up to sets of 8-12 reps.","Higher degree of difficulty than with the captain's chair or parallel bars
Emphasizes the lower part of the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles
Can be performed anywhere with a bar to hang from
Can be the main focus of a minimalist core routine
Builds grip, hamstring flexibility, and straight-arm pulling strength","Hang from a chin-up bar with both arms extended at arms length in top of you using either a wide grip or a medium grip. The legs should be straight down with the pelvis rolled slightly backwards. This will be your starting position.

barbell-ab-rollout-on-knees,Barbell Ab Rollout - On Knees,Abdominals,Barbell,"The barbell roll-out is an abdominal exercise that utilizes a barbell in the place of an ab roller. It is best performed with a barbell that has rotating collars, and is considered more difficult than other ab roller variations. Many lifters may not be able to perform a single rep at first, but once they can perform these for reps, they'll be rewarded with a seriously strong core.","Works core strength and stability
Engages all muscle groups of the core
Encourages coordination, mobility, and lumbar positioning
Unlike with an ab roller, grip width can be altered based on shoulder comfort","Hold an Olympic barbell loaded with 5-10lbs on each side and kneel on the floor.
Now place the barbell on the floor in front of you so that you are on all your hands and knees (as in a kneeling push up position). This will be your starting position.

After a second pause at the stretched position, start pulling yourself back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Go slowly and keep your abs tight at all times.",8.9
barbell-squat,Barbell Squat,Quadriceps,Barbell,"The barbell back squat is a popular compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups and overall strength. It's the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher.","Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
Requires back and core strength to maintain torso positioning
Can be used to improve conditioning and cardiovascular health
Considered by many to be ""the king of exercises""","Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed.
Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible.
Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward.",8.9

While it can be a strength-focused movement, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or chest-focused training.","Adds size and strength to the pecs
Targets the lower chest
May be more shoulder-friendly than the flat bench for certain lifters","Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench.
Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack.
As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your lower chest.
After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up).
Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.
If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.
Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your lower chest and nowhere else.
Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.",8.9

Popular among gym goers of all experience levels, this move can be done seated or standing. It is generally performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or higher, as part of the arm-focused portion of a workout.","Permits wrist supination, unlike the barbell version
Allows you to target the biceps
More time efficient than the alternating dumbbell curl
Simple way to build biceps size and strength","Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand at arm's length. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. This will be your starting position.
Now, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.

dumbbell-squat,Dumbbell squat,Quadriceps,Dumbbell,"The dumbbell squat is a classic lower-body exercise that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. While this variation is usually performed with relatively light weights for high reps, it can also be used as a substitute for squats or the trap-bar deadlift in any workout.","Strengthens the legs, back, and grip
Forces the core to stabilize while lower body moves
Doesn't heavily load the top of the spine like back squats do","Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).
Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.
Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
Begin to raise your torso as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.

front-barbell-squat,Barbell front squat,Quadriceps,Barbell,"The barbell front squat is a compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups. With the barbell racked in front of the body on the anterior delts, the front squat emphasizes the quads and glutes, but also upper back and core strength to remain upright. Front squats can be trained as an alternative to back squats, as an accessory movement for either squats or deadlifts, or for strength and muscle on their own. Many lifters and athletes prefer them to back squats, although they can be uncomfortable and difficult to learn at first.","Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
Builds upper-back and core strength to stay upright
Encourages good mobility in the hips, shoulders, ankles
May be more spine-friendly than back squats
Multiple grip options: rack, crossed arms, ""zombie"" arms, or holding onto straps that are wrapped around the bar","This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.
Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.

v-bar-pulldown,Close-grip pull-down,Lats,Cable,"The close-grip pull-down is a variation on the lat pull-down that is performed with an overhand grip and the hands slightly closer than shoulder-width apart. This increases the range of motion beyond wider grips, and may increase the time under tension in each rep. This variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of a back or upper-body workout.","Emphasizes the middle of the back
Easy to learn and execute
Cables provide constant tension on the targeted muscles","Sit down on a pull-down machine with a V-Bar attached to the top pulley.
Adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
Grab the V-bar with the palms facing each other (a neutral grip). Stick your chest out and lean yourself back slightly (around 30-degrees) in order to better engage the lats. This will be your starting position.
Using your lats, pull the bar down as you squeeze your shoulder blades. Continue until your chest nearly touches the V-bar. Exhale as you execute this motion. Tip: Keep the torso stationary throughout the movement.

Can go heavier than other triceps isolation movements
Performing this move seated eliminates any balance challenge and allows you to focus on the triceps","Sit down on a bench with back support and grasp a dumbbell with both hands and hold it overhead at arm's length. Tip: a better way is to have somebody hand it to you especially if it is very heavy. The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hand should be facing inward. This will be your starting position.
Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semi-circular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
You can perform this exercise standing as well but this puts strain on your back especially if you are using heavy dumbbells like 95 lbs or so.
Another variation is to use an EZ or straight bar instead in which case you will be holding the bar from the inside (around 5 inches between both hands) with the palms facing forward (pronated grip).
There is also a bar that has parallel bars inside (often referred to as a triceps blaster) and this can also be used for this exercise.

wide-grip-barbell-bench-press,Wide-grip bench press,Chest,Barbell,"The wide-grip bench press is a compound exercise targeting the chest and, to a lesser extent, the triceps. The main difference between this exercise and the standard bench press is that the hands are placed farther apart on the bar. Many lifters find they can handle more weight going wide than with narrower grips, although it's also worth noting that plenty of banged-up lifters have said benching with a wide grip may also have contributed to their shoulder injuries and pain. The wide-grip bench is often used as a chest-building movement in chest or upper-body workouts, or as an accessory movement for the traditional bench press.","Targets the chest even more than the standard bench press

Using a wide, pronated (palms forward) grip that is around 3 inches away from shoulder width (for each hand), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. The bar will be perpendicular to the torso and the floor. This will be your starting position.
As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your lower chest.
After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.
Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else.
Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.",8.9

Make sure that your heels are resting comfortably against the base of the foot pedals and that the straps are secured. Select the program that you wish to use, if applicable. Sit up straight and bend forward at the hips.
There are three phases of movement when using a rower. The first phase is when you come forward on the rower. Your knees are bent and against your chest. Your upper body is leaning slightly forward while still maintaining good posture.Next, push against the foot pedals and extend your legs while bringing your hands to your upper abdominal area, squeezing your shoulders back as you do so. To avoid straining your back, use primarily your leg and hip muscles.
The recovery phase simply involves straightening your arms, bending the knees, and bringing your body forward again as you transition back into the first phase.",8.9
snatch-deadlift,Snatch Deadlift,Hamstrings,Barbell,,,"The snatch deadlift strengthens the first pull of the snatch. Begin with a wide snatch grip with the barbell placed on the platform. The feet should be directly under the hips, with the feet turned out. Squat down to the bar, keeping the back in absolute extension with the head facing forward.

Great high-rep burnout with light weight","With a dumbbell in each hand and the palms facing your torso, bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Make sure that you keep the head up. The upper arms should be close to the torso and parallel to the floor while the forearms are pointing towards the floor as the hands hold the weights. Tip: There should be a 90-degree angle between the forearms and the upper arm. This is your starting position.
Keeping the upper arms stationary, use the triceps to lift the weights as you exhale until the forearms are parallel to the floor and the whole arms are extended. Like many other arm exercises, only the forearm moves.
After a second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbells back to their starting position as you inhale.
Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
This exercise can be executed also one arm at a time.
Also, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a single hand handle or rope attachment instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case of the single hand handle, the palms should be facing up as opposed to the torso.",8.8

Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).
Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.

Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Tip: For better range of motion you may also place the ball of your feet on a wooden block but be careful as this option requires more balance and a sturdy block.
Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.

Excellent way to maintain or improve cardiovascular health
Can track heart rate and time performed
Not dependent on weather like walking outside","To begin, step onto the treadmill and select the desired option from the menu. Most treadmills have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.
Treadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than walking outside. When walking, you should move at a moderate to fast pace, not a leisurely one. Being an activity of lower intensity, walking doesnâ€™t burn as many calories as some other activities, but still provides great benefit. A 150 lb person will burn about 175 calories walking 4 miles per hour for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories running twice as fast. Maintain proper posture as you walk, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate.",8.2

Stiff-legged deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. Feel free to wear a weight belt to protect your lower back.","Strengthens and builds active flexibility in the glutes and hamstrings

Use a box of an appropriate height for this exercise. Load the bar to a weight that still requires effort, but isn't so heavy that speed is compromised. Typically, that will be between 50-70% of your one rep max.
Position the bar on your upper back, shoulder blades retracted, back arched and everything tight head to toe. This will be the starting position.
Unrack the bar and position yourself in front of the box. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box, ensuring that you descend under control and don't crash onto the surface.

The clean utilizes the muscles of the hips, legs, glutes, back, and biceps, while the push-press utilizes the shoulders and triceps. It differs from the clean and press in that the push-press allows you to use lower-body momentum to power through the most difficult part of the press.

total-fitness-dumbbell-racked-reverse-lunge,Dumbbell racked reverse lunge,Quadriceps,Dumbbell,"The dumbbell racked reverse lunge is a popular lower-body movement that targets the muscles of the quads, glutes, hamstrings, and hips. Holding dumbbells in the racked position further challenges the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Lunge variations are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per leg or more, as part of the lower-body portion of a workout. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing split squats instead.","Creates less torque in the front knee and better stability with the front leg as the stationary leg
The racked position forces the core to work harder to keep from rounding forward as you lunge
Helps improve hip flexibility and core stability",,0.0

It has less range of motion than a regular dumbbell bench press, but still targets the chest, triceps, and anterior delts. By performing it with one arm, you can strengthen weakness on certain sides or simply use it as a way to challenge the core more during this exercise.","Builds chest and triceps size and strength
Free hand can help perform forced reps
Takes your legs out of the movement, giving all the responsibility to your core and upper body",,0.0
total-fitness-dumbbell-snatch,Single-arm dumbbell snatch-,Quadriceps,Dumbbell,"The single-arm dumbbell snatch is an explosive exercise that builds full-body power and targets the muscles of the hips, back, and shoulders.
