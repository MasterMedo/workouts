Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip.

Execution

Pull bar to upper waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.

Comments

Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension. A wide overhand grip involves overall back musculature while slightly emphasizing Rear Delt, Infraspinatus and Teres Minor involvement. Also known as Pendlay Row.

Comments

Back of upper arms should remain on pad throughout movement. If machine has secondary lever (as shown), it is not as essential to position elbows in-line with the primary fulcrum, as would otherwise be required.

Long head (lateral head) of Biceps Brachii is activated significantly more than short head (medial head) of Biceps Brachii since short head enters into active insufficiency as it continues to contract. Long head of Triceps Brachii is only significantly activated as antagonist stabilizer when it approaches passive insufficiency as elbow nears full flexion.

Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back behind suspension handles. Position body and legs straight at desired angle hanging from handles with arms straight. Internally rotate shoulders so elbows are positioned directly outwards with arms straight or slightly bent. Shoulder should be positioned approximately 90° relative to torso position.

Execution

Pull handles out to sides while keeping stiff elbow position and maintaining shoulder at 90° plane to torso throughout exercise. Raise up until upper arms are in-line to one another. Return to original position in same plane and repeat.

Comments

Upper arms should travel in transverse path at shoulder level without allowing elbows to drop to minimize Latissimus Dorsi involvement. A very upright position (ie: very light resistance) with one foot positioned slightly back (see 'Easier') is typically required for proper execution. Take care to maintain tension on suspension trainer near top of movement. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright or stepping out at top of movement. This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. See Suspended Reverse Fly performed with dual anchor suspension trainer.

Grasp suspension handles and position bent elbows to each sides of waist.

Step back until suspension straps are taut. While keeping bent elbows to side, step forward slightly so body reclines back behind suspension handles.

Execution

Pull handles apart from each side, while keeping fixed elbow position and body and legs straight throughout movement. Raise forward so handles are to each side of body. Return back until handles come back together in front of body. Repeat.

Comments

A very upright position (ie: very light resistance) with one foot positioned back slightly (see 'Easier') is typically required for proper execution. Take care to maintain tension on suspension trainer near top of movement. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright or stepping out at top of movement. This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings.

This movement may involve more shoulder girdle retraction compared to traditional rotator cuff exercises such as Cable Shoulder External Rotation, where movement is purely shoulder external rotation. However, this movement can be performed more 'strict' if desired to minimize shoulder girdle movement. Similarly, traditional shoulder external rotator work calls for strict 90º elbow positioning. In this exercise utilizing bodyweight, elbow angle could be decreased in order to offer appropriate (lighter) starting resistance. In any case, attempt to keep elbow angle fixed throughout movement.

Sit slightly forward on bench or platform in order to grasp cable bar attachment. With elbow width overhand grip, straighten torso upright and slide hips back until knees are only   slightly bent.

Execution

Pull cable attachment toward upper chest, just below neck, with elbows up out to sides until elbows travel slightly behind back. Keep upper arms horizontal, perpendicular to trunk. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched forward. Repeat.

Comments

Elbow width is determined when elbows are raised at height of shoulders out to sides. The relatively powerful Latissimus Dorsi becomes involved:


if upper arm travels closer than perpendicular to trunk
if torso is positioned forward beyond vertical


Elbows should be kept same height as shoulders when approaching upper chest. Much lighter resistance is required as Cable Seated Row.

Execution

Raise upper arms to sides until elbows are shoulder height. Maintain upper arms perpendicular to torso and fixed elbow position (10° to 30° angle) throughout exercise. Maintain elbows height above wrists by raising ""pinkie finger"" side up. Lower and repeat.

Comments

Dumbbells are raised by shoulder transverse abduction, not external rotation, nor extension. Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize relatively powerful latissimus dorsi involvement. This mean at top of movement, elbows (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to shoulders since elbows are slightly bent forward. To exercise posterior deltoid and not lateral deltoid, keep upper torso close to horizontal. Positioning upper torso at 45° is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. The spine can be flexed to achieve this positioning if thighs can provide sufficient support for torso. Some individuals may not be able to bend sufficiently at hip due to flexibility or girth constraints. Also see Rear Lateral Raise Errors and Low Back Alignment Exceptions.

Execution

Keeping body straight, bring handles toward top of shoulders by flexing arms, while keeping elbows pointed forward. Return by straightening arms and repeat.

Comments

Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright. Also referred to as Suspended Biceps Curl, arguably somewhat of a misnomer as applied to form shown here. The positioning of arms, with elbows high, places short head (medial head) of Bicep Brachii in active insufficiency as arm continues to flex. The long head of Biceps Brachii (lateral head) and in particular, Brachialis are primary movers in this position. Compare to Suspended Biceps Curl.

Allowing elbows to drop slightly during flexion may somewhat decrease active insufficiency of biceps brachii. However, this technique may not ideally emphasize biceps' involvement, since this position prevents body from achieving a more upright position at end of movement at any given initial body angle, thereby creating a peak contraction (greatest resistance at top of movement) on elbow flexors which enter into yet another related compromised mechanical position (see Tension Potential and Muscle Length-tension Relationship). This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. See Gravity Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance.

Lay on back under fixed horizontal bar. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip. Place back of heels on elevated surface.


Execution


Keeping body straight, pull body up to bar. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched forward. Repeat.


Comments

Fixed bar should be just high enough to allow arm to fully extend. Placing back of heels on elevated surface is optional. This exercise is typically performed without added resistance, although a weight vest can be worn or additional weight can be placed on belly or pelvis. Partner can add and remove weight, and keep weight from sliding off belly. Resistance can be further reduced by performing movement from higher bar and/or positioning heels on floor (see Inverted Row on high bar). See Gravity Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance. Also known as Weighted Body Row or Weighted Supine Row.

Comments

Torso should be kept as close to horizontal while allowing for full arm extension. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, try bending knees more. Placing weight plates on higher bar lightens resistance at top where strength lessens, without compromising range of motion. See Gravity Vectors to understand how this positioning, altering direction of load, affects exercise resistance throughout movement (resistance curve).

Stand facing horizontal bar positioned lower to upper chest height. Step toward bar so chest makes contact. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip. Raise elbows up to shoulder height. Place feet forward on floor so body is reclined back with legs, hips and spine straight.

Execution

Lower body while keeping body straight, elbows high, and upper arms perpendicular to torso, until arms are extended straight. Pull shoulders toward bar while keeping elbows up high until upper arms are parallel to one another, or just beyond. Repeat.

Comments

If elbows fall so upper arms no longer travel perpendicular to trunk, Latissimus Dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be positioned directly lateral to shoulders at highest position. Pulling bar to lower chest is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. A higher bar (ie: lighter resistance) is required than what is required on Inverted Row. Bar height can be adjusted to vary resistance. See Gravity Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance. Also known as Body Row or Supine Row.

Comments

Keep elbows pointed high while maintaining slight bend through elbows (10° to 30° angle) throughout movement. At top of movement, elbows (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to shoulders since elbows are slightly bent forward. Dumbbells are raised by shoulder abduction, not external rotation. If elbows drop lower than wrists, front deltoids become primary mover instead of lateral deltoids. To keep resistance targeted to side delt, torso is bent over slightly. See other view and Lateral Raise Errors.

Position suspension handles higher than arms' length above floor. Sit on floor and grasp handles. Position body supine hanging from handles with arms straight, shoulders under handles, body straight, and back of heels on floor. Internally rotate shoulders so elbows are positioned directly outwards.

Execution

Pull body up while keeping elbows pointed directly out to each side and body and legs straight. Pull until elbows are directly lateral to each side without allowing upper arms to angle downwards. Return until arms are extended straight and shoulders are stretched forward, maintaining high elbow position. Repeat.

Comments

If elbows fall so upper arms no longer travels perpendicular to trunk, Latissimus Dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be positioned directly lateral to shoulders at highest position throughout movement. Executing exercise with elbows dropping lower than shoulders is not sufficient position to target rear deltoids. A more upright position (ie: lighter resistance) is required than what is used on Suspended Inverted Row for General Back.

Execution

Pull bar to waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched forward. Repeat.

Comments

Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.

Comments

The biceps may be exercised alternating (as described), simultaneous, or in simultaneous-alternating fashion. When elbows are fully flexed, they can travel forward slightly allowing forearms to be no more than vertical.

Sit on seat and grasp handles with each hand. Place feet on vertically angled platform. Slide hips back with knees slightly bent.

Execution

Pull handles to waist while straightening torso upright. Pull shoulders back and push chest forward while arching back. Return until arms are extended, shoulders are stretched forward, and lower back is flexed forward. Repeat.

Comments

Exercise is performed on apparatus with no chest pad, in contrast to standard lever seated row machine. This exercise is more similar to Cable Seated Row. Begin with light weight and add additional weight gradually to allow lower back adequate adaptation. Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch. Full range of motion through lower back will vary from person to person. For even greater hip and low back articulation, hips may be slid back further with knees straighter. See Cable Seated Row Question and Dangerous Exercise Essay. Also see Lever Straight Back Seated Row (no chest pad).

Comments

Stirrup can be hung from one side of rack for easier access. Feet can be staggered and bent slightly (if needed) to allow armpit to rest near top of pad. Back of upper arm should remain on pad throughout movement. The long head (lateral head) of Biceps Brachii is activated significantly more than short head (medial head) of Biceps Brachii since short head enters into active insufficiency  as it continues to contract.

Sit on end of bench with dumbbell in each hand and legs together. Position dumbbells with palms facing inward and arms hanging down straight.

Execution

Raise dumbbells forward and upward until upper arms are above horizontal. Lower to original vertical position and repeat.

Comments

Height of movement may depend on range of motion. Raise should be limited to height achieved just before tightness is felt in shoulder capsule, which may be slightly higher than which is felt in the palms down version. Alternatively, height just above horizontal may be considered adequate. Thumbs up hand position, referred to as 'open can' position, may slightly decrease involvement of Lateral Deltoid while slightly increasing Clavicular Pectoralis involvement depending upon degree of shoulder external rotation. Elbows may be kept straight or slightly bent throughout movement. Also see Dumbbell Alternating Seated Full Can Front Raise. However, thumbs up position with external rotation of the shoulder (AKA: 'Open Can') as compared to palms down position with shoulder internal rotation may increase range of motion of shoulder flexion before subacromial impingement is experienced. This positioning also decreases Lateral Deltoid involvement while increasing Clavicular Pectoralis activation.

Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back behind suspension handles.
Position body and legs straight at desired angle hanging from handles with arms straight. Internally rotate shoulders so elbows are positioned directly outwards.

Execution

Pull body up while keeping elbows pointed directly out to each side and body and legs straight. Pull until elbows are directly lateral to each side without allowing elbows to drop. Return until arms are extended straight and shoulders are stretched forward, maintaining high elbow position. Repeat.

Comments

If elbows fall so upper arms no longer travels perpendicular to trunk, Latissimus Dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be positioned directly lateral to shoulders at highest position throughout movement. Executing exercise with elbows dropping lower than shoulders is not sufficient position to target rear deltoids. A more upright position (ie: lighter resistance) is required than what is used on Suspended Row for General Back. See Gravity Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright.

This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. Also known as Suspended Rear Delt Body Row, Suspended Rear Delt Supine Row, or Suspended Rear Delt Inverted Row.

With lever handles to sides, bend knees slightly and bend over with back straight. Grasp lower handles.

 Pull lever handles up to sides. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.


Comments

Torso should be kept horizontal if flexibility allows. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, try bending knees more. Placing weight plates on higher bar lightens resistance at top where strength lessens, without compromising range of motion. See Gravity Vectors to understand how this positioning, altering direction of load, affects exercise resistance (resistance curve). Also see wide grip form.

Lay on back with belly under fixed horizontal bar. Bend knees and position feet on floor. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip. Turn elbows outward to sides.

Walk forward under bar while pulling upper chest close to bar. With heels on floor, position body at angle under bar with legs, hips and spine straight. Position forearms perpendicular to body, orientated forward. Also, position upper arms perpendicular to body, orientated to each side.

Execution

Keeping hips on floor, low back straight, and elbow pointed out to sides; pull torso up to bar. Return when upper arms are just beyond parallel to one another. Lower body downward until arms are extended straight. Return and repeat.

Comments

If elbows fall so upper arms no longer travels perpendicular to trunk, Latissimus Dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be positioned directly lateral to shoulders at highest position. Pulling bar to lower chest is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids.

Comments

Pronated grip will internally rotate shoulders so elbows are kept at height of shoulders. Preventing elbows from dropping below shoulders will minimize Latissimus Dorsi involvement. With thumbs down grip, shoulder must be deliberately internally rotated to keep elbow at proper height. Some machines allow for a more neutral overhand grip.

Keeping upper arm perpendicular to torso and dumbbells just below elbows, pull dumbbells up until elbows are just above shoulders. Return and repeat.

Comments

If upper arm travels closer than perpendicular to trunk, latissimus dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be raised directly lateral to shoulders. Bench should be just high enough to prevent dumbbells from hitting floor and close to horizontal. Exercise can also be performed on Lying Rear Delt Apparatus or on Incline Bench adjusted to height close to horizontal yet high enough to permit full range of motion at lowest range of motion.

Execution

Raise lever handles toward shoulders. Lower handles until arms are fully extended. Repeat.

Comments

Seat should be adjusted to allow armpit to rest near top of pad. Back of upper arm should remain on pad throughout movement. If machine has secondary lever (as shown), it is not as essential to position elbows in-line with the primary fulcrum, as would otherwise be required. Long head (lateral head) of Biceps Brachii is activated significantly more than short head (medial head) of Biceps Brachii since short head enters into active insufficiency as it continues to contract. Long head of Triceps Brachii is only significant activated as antagonist stabilizer when it approaches passive insufficiency as elbow nears full flexion.

Comments

If upper arm travels closer than perpendicular to trunk, latissimus dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be raised directly lateral to shoulders. Positioning torso at 45° is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. Keep torso bent over approximately horizontal. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility).

If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. If low back is rounded due to poor form, slowly lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. Much lighter resistance is required as Smith Bent-over Row.

Comments

Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.

Comments

With heavy resistance, back pad will need to be adjusted to keep torso close to arm pad. Adjust seat height, so back of upper arms rest on padding. If seat is too high, shoulder will need to rise near end of extension to complete final range of motion since forearms will make contact with pad before lockout. If seat is too low, range of motion will be compromised because elbows will not be completely flexed at beginning of movement.

Stand facing high pulley positioned slightly above head level. Grasp stirrup with one hand and step back so arm is straight. With leg of opposite side as loaded arm, plant forefoot far back on floor. Slightly bend knee of forward leg, same direction as foot. Allow shoulder with stirrup to be pulled forward with twist through waist.

Execution

Pull cable attachment to side of torso and rotate body toward side of pulling arm. Pull shoulder back and push chest forward. Return until arm is extended and shoulder is pulled forward. Repeat. Continue with opposite arm.

Comments

In standing position, both spinal rotation and hip rotation contribute to body's rotation. Because rear leg is only supported by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized (hip internal rotation / transverse adduction) much greater than hip of rear leg since forward leg offers more secured base of support.

Opposite Stance

With the legs in opposite stance, body will be turned more away from cable resulting in slight difference of muscle involvement throughout movement.

During movement:


less spinal rotation
more hip external rotators / transverse abduction (forward/opposite side hip)
less hip internal rotators / transverse adduction (rear/same side hip)



Near end of pull:

less shoulder extension
more shoulder abduction

Comments

Maintain fixed slightly bent elbow position throughout exercise. Stirrup is raised by combining shoulder abduction and flexion. Slight shoulder external rotation may occur with elbows bent. Front Deltoid assists shoulder flexion if upper arm angle is slightly   high. Rear Deltoid assists shoulder horizontal abduction if upper arm angle is slightly low.

Execution

Raise stirrup forward and upward until arm is well above horizontal or cable makes contact with underside of upper arm. Lower and repeat. Repeat with opposite arm.

Comments

Height of movement may depend on range of motion or when cable makes contact with underside of forearm. Raise should be limited to height achieved just before tightness is felt within shoulder capsule. Alternatively, height just above horizontal may be considered adequate. However, thumbs up position with external rotation of the shoulder (AKA: 'Open Can') as compared to palms down position with shoulder internal rotation may increase range of motion of shoulder flexion before subacromial impingement is experienced. This positioning also decreases Lateral Deltoid involvement while increasing Clavicular Pectoralis activation.

Comments

Dumbbells are raised by shoulder transverse abduction, not external rotation, nor extension. Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize latissimus dorsi involvement. Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize latissimus dorsi involvement. Bench should be high enough to prevent dumbbells from hitting floor and close to horizontal. Exercise can also be performed on Lying Rear Delt Apparatus or on Incline Bench adjusted to height close to horizontal yet high enough to permit full range of motion at lowest range of motion. Lying at 45° is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. Also see Rear Lateral Raise Errors.

Execution

Keeping upper arm perpendicular to torso and dumbbells just below elbows, pull dumbbells up until elbows are just above shoulders. Return and repeat.

Comments

If upper arm travels closer than perpendicular to trunk, latissimus dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be raised directly lateral to shoulders. Bench should be just high enough to prevent dumbbells from hitting floor and close to horizontal. Also see exercise performed on Lying Rear Delt Apparatus. Lying on 45° incline is too high of angle to target rear deltoids. Horizontal surface offers more ideal surface as long as bench is high enough to permit full range of motion at bottom most position. Much lighter resistance is required as Dumbbell Incline Row.

Grasp dumbbells to each side. Bend knees and bend over through hips with back flat, close to horizontal. Position elbows with slight bend and palms facing together.

Execution

Raise upper arms to sides until elbows are shoulder height. Maintain upper arms perpendicular to torso and fixed elbow position (10° to 30° angle) throughout exercise. Maintain height of elbows above wrists by raising ""pinkie finger"" side up. Lower and repeat.

Comments

Dumbbells are raised by shoulder transverse abduction, not external rotation, nor extension. Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize relatively powerful latissimus dorsi involvement. In other words, at top of movement, elbows (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to shoulders since elbows are slightly bent forward.

To exercise posterior deltoid and not lateral deltoid, keep torso close to horizontal. Positioning torso at 45° is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. If low back is rounded due to poor form, slowly lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. Also see Rear Lateral Raise Errors.

Sit on curl machine. Grasp lever handles with underhand grip. Align elbows at same pivot point as fulcrum of lever while placing back of arms up on pads.

Execution

Pull lever handles toward shoulders. Return handles until arms are fully extended. Repeat.

Comments

Back of upper arms should remain on pad throughout movement. If machine has secondary lever (as shown), it is not as essential to position elbows in-line with the primary fulcrum, as would otherwise be required.

Long head (lateral head) of Biceps Brachii is activated significantly more than short head (medial head) of Biceps Brachii since short head enters into active insufficiency as it continues to contract. Long head of Triceps Brachii is only significantly activated as antagonist stabilizer when it approaches passive insufficiency as elbow nears full flexion.

Straddle lever bar facing handles. Bend knees slightly and bend over handles with back straight. Grasp wide grip handles with overhand grip. With arms extended, position torso just high enough to allow weight to make contact with floor.

Execution

With elbows out to sides, pull bar up toward upper chest until elbows are same height as shoulders or just beyond, keeping upper arm perpendicular to torso. Return and repeat.

Comments

If upper arm travels closer than perpendicular to trunk, latissimus dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be raised directly lateral to shoulders. Keep torso bent over as far as possible allowing just enough height to fully extend arms. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility).

If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. If low back is rounded due to poor form, slowly lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. Much lighter resistance is required as Lever T-Bar Row.

Execution

Pull body up so sides of chest make contact with handles while keeping body straight. Return until arms are extended straight and shoulders are stretched forward. Repeat.

Comments

Handles should be positioned to allow for full arm extension, no lower. Instead of mounting from a seated or lying position, position can be assumed by stepping back with handles grasped in each hand until arms are straight forward. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back and under suspension handles. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright, minimizing contact with ground. See Gravity Vector  for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance. This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings.

Stand with toes under bar facing fulcrum. Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip.

Execution

Pull bar to waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.

Comments

Exact stance from bar will depend upon height of fulcrum and length of lever. Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi, since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, grasp bar in standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension. A wide overhand grip involves overall back musculature while slightly emphasizing Rear Delt, Infraspinatus and Teres Minor involvement.

Execution

Pull shoulders toward bar while keeping body straight, elbows to sides of shoulders, and upper arms perpendicular to torso, until upper arms are parallel to one another, or just beyond. Lower body while keeping elbows positioned high to sides of shoulders until arms are extended straight. Repeat.

Comments

If elbows fall so upper arms no longer travel perpendicular to trunk, Latissimus Dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be positioned directly lateral to shoulders at highest position. Pulling bar to lower chest is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. A higher bar (ie: lighter resistance) is required than what is required on Inverted Row.

Comments

Try to keep elbows nearly straight throughout exercise. Target muscle, Rectus Abdominis practically contracts isometrically since only a small degree of waist flexion occurs under resistance and, with the assistance of the External Oblique, act to stabilize spine.

Pull bar to upper waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.


Comments

Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Platform (as shown) is only needed if smith machine does not allow bar to be lowered to lowest position. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility ). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension  and less shoulder extension  range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.

Grasp bar with overhand wide grip. Position forefeet on floor just behind low bar or on bench just behind high bar.

Execution

Lower body until arms and shoulders are fully extended. If necessary, use minimal assistance of lower body to control descent allowing knees to bend. Pull body up until bar touches back of neck, again with minimal assistance from lower body. Repeat.

Comments

If bar is too low, knees may need to spread apart at bottom of motion (as shown) to achieve full range of motion. Range of motion will be compromised if grip is too wide. If lower body is used for assistance, Quadriceps are utilized.

Sit on curl machine placing back of arms on pad. Grasp lever handles with underhand grip. Align elbows at same pivot point as fulcrum of lever.

Execution

Raise lever handles toward shoulders. Lower handles until arms are fully extended. Repeat.

Comments

Seat should be adjusted to allow armpit to rest near top of pad. Back of upper arm should remain on pad throughout movement. If no resistance is experienced during initial range of motion, make sure seat is adjusted to allow for back of arm to be positioned flush against arm pad. If resistance is still not experienced, consider keeping wrists in a slight flexed position to compensate. If machine has secondary lever (as shown), it is not as essential to position elbows in-line with the primary fulcrum, as would otherwise be required. Long head (lateral head) of Biceps Brachii is activated significantly more than short head (medial head) of Biceps Brachii since short head enters into active insufficiency as it continues to contract. Long head of Triceps Brachii is only significant activated as antagonist stabilizer when it approaches passive insufficiency as elbow nears full flexion.

Grasp suspension handle(s) with one hand. Step back until handle is chest height when held to side of chest. Facing suspension apparatus with feet shoulder width apart, point other arm and its shoulder forward, parallel with angle of strap.

Execution

Rotate body and extended arm, reaching outward while lowering body downward by extending arm holding onto handle. Extend arms and shoulders in-line with suspension strap so body is angled back to one side. Return by raising body back upward in opposite motion, reaching outward and toward suspension strap while pulling handle back to side of chest until body is upright and arm parallel with angle of strap. Repeat and continue with opposite side.

Comments

This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. Some suspension trainer brands allow independent use of only one handle, whereas, more popular brands require either anchoring unused handle within stirrup of gripped handle or grasping both handles with one hand.

External hip rotation  is seen in lower swinging hip, whereas, internal hip rotation  is observed in upper anchored hip. Muscles rotating hips may arguably be involved in movement, although relative intensity appears to be negligible, particularly since forefeet are not planted firmly on surface in lower position where hips are more rotated, preventing significant torque to be achieved, which suggests hip rotation is largely passive.

In contrast, a wide base of support with heels apart allows allows for adequate torque for spinal rotation. However, if hips rotate more than spine, as typically performed and as shown, range of motion through waist quite is limited.

An alternative form is to place feet in-line, perpendicular to suspension straps with lower foot forward. This turns pelvis 90º, stabilizing hip movement so waist can articulate through greater range of motion. Check back for future updates for its possible inclusion into ExRx.net Exercise Directory.

Some manuals demonstrate Power Pull with high elbow position on pulling arm. An elbow positioned at height of shoulder would remove lat involvement requiring smaller muscles of upper back (ie: rear delt) to be emphasized.

Position suspension handle higher than arms' length above floor. Sit on floor and grasp handles. Position body supine hanging from handle with arm straight, shoulders under handles, body straight, and back of heels on floor, positioned apart. Place resting arm straight against side or front of thigh.

Execution

Keeping body straight, pull body up with arm so handle comes in close contact with side of chest. Return until arm is extended straight and shoulder is stretched forward. Repeat.

Comments

Handle should be just high enough to allow arm to fully extend. See Gravity Vectors for greater understanding of body angle influences resistance. This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics ring. Also known as One Arm Body Row or One Arm Supine Row.

Execution

Pull one lever handle toward shoulder. Return handle until arm is fully extended. Repeat with opposite arm. Continue alternating movement between arms.

Comments

Back of upper arms should remain on pad throughout movement. If machine has secondary lever (as shown), elbows can be positioned further away from primary fulcrum. Long head (lateral head) of Biceps Brachii is activated significantly more than short head (medial head) of Biceps Brachii since short head enters into active insufficiency as it continues to contract. Long head of Triceps Brachii is only significantly activated as antagonist stabilizer when it approaches passive insufficiency as elbow nears full flexion.

Comments

Platform height should allow pivot point of shoulders to be aligned with lever fulcrum. Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize relatively powerful latissimus dorsi involvement. At top of movement, elbows (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to shoulders since elbows are slightly bent forward.

To exercise posterior deltoid and not lateral deltoid, keep torso close to horizontal. Positioning torso at 45° is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). Apparatus was originally designed to be used for Extended Arm Kneeling Lateral Raise. Also see Rear View Angle.
