Comments

Platform height should allow pivot point of shoulders to be aligned with lever fulcrum. Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize relatively powerful latissimus dorsi involvement. At top of movement, elbows (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to shoulders since elbows are slightly bent forward.

Grasp suspension handles and position bent elbows to each sides of waist.

Step back until suspension straps are taut. While keeping bent elbows to side, step forward slightly so body reclines back behind suspension handles.

Execution

Pull handles apart from each side, while keeping fixed elbow position and body and legs straight throughout movement. Raise forward so handles are to each side of body. Return back until handles come back together in front of body. Repeat.

Comments

A very upright position (ie: very light resistance) with one foot positioned back slightly (see 'Easier') is typically required for proper execution. Take care to maintain tension on suspension trainer near top of movement. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright or stepping out at top of movement. This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings.

This movement may involve more shoulder girdle retraction compared to traditional rotator cuff exercises such as Cable Shoulder External Rotation, where movement is purely shoulder external rotation. However, this movement can be performed more 'strict' if desired to minimize shoulder girdle movement. Similarly, traditional shoulder external rotator work calls for strict 90º elbow positioning. In this exercise utilizing bodyweight, elbow angle could be decreased in order to offer appropriate (lighter) starting resistance. In any case, attempt to keep elbow angle fixed throughout movement.

Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip.

Execution

Pull bar to upper waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.

Comments

Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight.

Execution

Comments

Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Platform (as shown) is only needed if smith machine does not allow bar to be lowered to lowest position. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility ). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.

Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back behind suspension handles. Position body and legs straight at desired angle hanging from handles with arms straight. Internally rotate shoulders so elbows are positioned directly outwards with arms straight or slightly bent. Shoulder should be positioned approximately 90° relative to torso position.

Execution

Pull handles out to sides while keeping stiff elbow position and maintaining shoulder at 90° plane to torso throughout exercise. Raise up until upper arms are in-line to one another. Return to original position in same plane and repeat.

Comments

Upper arms should travel in transverse path at shoulder level without allowing elbows to drop to minimize Latissimus Dorsi involvement. A very upright position (ie: very light resistance) with one foot positioned slightly back (see 'Easier') is typically required for proper execution. Take care to maintain tension on suspension trainer near top of movement. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright or stepping out at top of movement. This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings.

Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body is reclined back. Position palms up or slightly inward.

Execution

Bring handles toward shoulders by flexing arms, while keeping elbows pointed forward. Return by straightening arms and repeat.

Comments

Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright. Also known as Suspended Biceps Curl, arguably somewhat of a misnomer. The positioning of arms, with elbows high, places short head (medial head) of Bicep Brachii in active insufficiency as arm continues to flex. The long head of Biceps Brachii (lateral head) and in particular, Brachialis are primary movers in this position.

Allowing elbows to drop slightly during flexion may somewhat decrease active insufficiency of biceps brachii. However, this technique may not ideally emphasize biceps' involvement, since this position prevents body from achieving a more upright position at end of movement at any given initial body angle, thereby creating a peak contraction (greatest resistance at top of movement) on elbow flexors which enter into yet another related compromised mechanical position (see Tension Potential and Muscle Length-tension Relationship). This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings.

Position suspension handles higher than arms' length above floor. Sit on floor and grasp handles. Hang shoulders under handles with arms straight, back and hips straight, with knees bent and feet flat on floor.

Execution

Pull body up so sides of chest make contact with handles while keeping body straight. Return until arms are extended straight and shoulders are stretched forward. Repeat.

Comments

Handles should be positioned to allow for full arm extension, no lower. Instead of mounting from a seated or lying position, position can be assumed by stepping back with handles grasped in each hand until arms are straight forward. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back and under suspension handles. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright, minimizing contact with ground. See Gravity Vector for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance.

Sit on seat. Grasp handles and place back of upper arms parallel on padding with elbows approximately in line with lever's fulcrum.

Execution

Push lever down until arms are fully extended. Return until forearms contact upper arms. Repeat.

Comments

With heavy resistance, back pad will need to be adjusted to keep torso close to arm pad. Adjust seat height, so back of upper arms rest on padding. If seat is too high, shoulder will need to rise near end of extension to complete final range of motion since forearms will make contact with pad before lockout. If seat is too low, range of motion will be compromised because elbows will not be completely flexed at beginning of movement.

Execution

Pull bar to waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.

Comments

Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight.

Execution

Lower body back until arms are extended straight while keeping body straight and elbows high (upper arm perpendicular to torso). Pull body toward bar until upper arms are just beyond parallel to one another. Return and repeat.

Comments

If elbows fall so upper arms no longer travels perpendicular to trunk, Latissimus Dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be positioned directly lateral to shoulders at highest position. Pulling bar to lower chest is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. A higher bar (ie: lighter resistance) is required than what is required on Inverted Row.

Kneel on floor or mat. Grasp handles on wheel to each side with overhand grip. Position wheel near front of knees and lean over wheel with arms extended downward, supporting upper body.

Execution

With arms straight, roll wheel out as far as possible. Lower body gently to floor extending arms forward. Raise body back up by flexing hips and pulling arms back to original position. Return until hips are extended. Repeat.

Comments

Keep elbows straight or nearly straight throughout exercise. Also known as Wheel Kneeling Rollout. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques practically contract isometrically since little waist flexion occurs under resistance. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique act to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. See target muscle of rollout question. Also see Spot Reduction Myth and Lower Ab Myth.

Easier

Descending only part way down is much easier and can be performed in this way to progress into exercise. Movement can also be made easier by performing exercise up an incline (i.e. end of incline ab board or decline bench) or assisted by cable.

Comments

Exercise is performed on apparatus with no chest pad, in contrast to standard lever seated row machine. This exercise is more similar to Cable Seated Row. Begin with light weight and add additional weight gradually to allow lower back adequate adaptation. Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch. Full range of motion through lower back will vary from person to person. For even greater hip and low back articulation, hips may be slid back further with knees straighter.

Execution

Raise lever handles toward shoulders. Lower handles until arms are fully extended. Repeat.

Comments

Seat should be adjusted to allow armpit to rest near top of pad. Back of upper arm should remain on pad throughout movement. If machine has secondary lever (as shown), it is not as essential to position elbows in-line with the primary fulcrum, as would otherwise be required. Long head (lateral head) of Biceps Brachii is activated significantly more than short head (medial head) of Biceps Brachii since short head enters into active insufficiency as it continues to contract.

Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back behind suspension handles.Position body and legs straight at desired angle hanging from handles with arms straight. Internally rotate shoulders so elbows are positioned directly outwards.

Execution

Pull body up while keeping elbows pointed directly out to each side and body and legs straight. Pull until elbows are directly lateral to each side without allowing elbows to drop. Return until arms are extended straight and shoulders are stretched forward, maintaining high elbow position. Repeat.

Comments

If elbows fall so upper arms no longer travels perpendicular to trunk, Latissimus Dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be positioned directly lateral to shoulders at highest position throughout movement. Executing exercise with elbows dropping lower than shoulders is not sufficient position to target rear deltoids. A more upright position (ie: lighter resistance) is required than what is used on Suspended Row for General Back. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright.

Stand with toes under bar facing fulcrum. Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip.

Execution

Pull bar to waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.

Comments

Exact stance from bar will depend upon height of fulcrum and length of lever. Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi, since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion.

Execution

Pull cable attachment to side of torso and rotate body toward side of pulling arm. Pull shoulder back and push chest forward. Return until arm is extended and shoulder is pulled forward. Repeat. Continue with opposite arm.

Comments

In standing position, both spinal rotation and hip rotation contribute to body's rotation. Because rear leg is only supported by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized (hip internal rotation / transverse adduction) much greater than hip of rear leg since forward leg offers more secured base of support.

Opposite Stance

With the legs in opposite stance, body will be turned more away from cable resulting in slight difference of muscle involvement throughout movement.

During movement:

less spinal rotationmore hip external rotators / transverse abduction (forward/opposite side hip)less hip internal rotators / transverse adduction (rear/same side hip)

Grasp suspension handle(s) with one hand. Step back until handle is chest height when held to side of chest. Facing suspension apparatus with feet shoulder width apart, point other arm and its shoulder forward, parallel with angle of strap.

Execution

Rotate body and extended arm, reaching outward while lowering body downward by extending arm holding onto handle. Extend arms and shoulders in-line with suspension strap so body is angled back to one side. Return by raising body back upward in opposite motion, reaching outward and toward suspension strap while pulling handle back to side of chest until body is upright and arm parallel with angle of strap. Repeat and continue with opposite side.

Comments

This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. Some suspension trainer brands allow independent use of only one handle, whereas, more popular brands require either anchoring unused handle within stirrup of gripped handle or grasping both handles with one hand.

External hip rotation is seen in lower swinging hip, whereas, internal hip rotation is observed in upper anchored hip. Muscles rotating hips may arguably be involved in movement, although relative intensity appears to be negligible, particularly since forefeet are not planted firmly on surface in lower position where hips are more rotated, preventing significant torque to be achieved, which suggests hip rotation is largely passive.

In contrast, a wide base of support with heels apart allows allows for adequate torque for spinal rotation. However, if hips rotate more than spine, as typically performed and as shown, range of motion through waist quite is limited.

Comments

Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight.

Comments

Torso should be kept horizontal if flexibility allows. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, try bending knees more. Placing weight plates on higher bar lightens resistance at top where strength lessens, without compromising range of motion. See Gravity Vectors to understand how this positioning, altering direction of load, affects exercise resistance (resistance curve). Also see wide grip form.

Lay on back with belly under fixed horizontal bar. Bend knees and position feet on floor. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip. Turn elbows outward to sides.

Walk forward under bar while pulling upper chest close to bar. With heels on floor, position body at angle under bar with legs, hips and spine straight. Position forearms perpendicular to body, orientated forward. Also, position upper arms perpendicular to body, orientated to each side.

Execution

Keeping hips on floor, low back straight, and elbow pointed out to sides; pull torso up to bar. Return when upper arms are just beyond parallel to one another. Lower body downward until arms are extended straight. Return and repeat.

Comments

If elbows fall so upper arms no longer travels perpendicular to trunk, Latissimus Dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be positioned directly lateral to shoulders at highest position. Pulling bar to lower chest is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids.

Also known as Rear Delt Body Row on Hips or Rear Delt Supine Row on Hips.

Place belt or strap around end of suspension trainer. Hold belt in hand and stand away from suspension trainer so it hangs to one side. Place belt around head above ears and clamp belt snugly around head by tightly gripping ends close to head above ear closest to suspension trainer. Step further away from suspension trainer until it is taut. Lean away at angle against support of belt and suspension trainer by positioning feet closer to side of suspension trainer while keeping head and body straight.

Execution

Lower angle of body by tilting head to side of suspension trainer. Increase angle of body by tilting head away from side of suspension trainer. Repeat and continue in opposite position.

Comments

This exercise can be performed with belt looped on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. Throughout movement, keep body straight and maintain tight grip on belt against side of head throughout movement. Use neck to pull belt rather than allowing hand to assist. 

Woven cotton or cloth belts tend to slip less, particularly on bald head. If belt slips from head, place small towel between belt and head. Belts not made specifically for weight training may cause injury if they fail under load in which they were not designed.

Adjust pulley approximately height of neck or head when seated. Attach belt on low pulley cable by attaching carabiner on belt buckle. Sit on bench with pulley to one side and feet apart. Place head in belt loop. With belt above ears, clamp belt snugly around head by tightly gripping ends close to side of head. Pull torso upright by bracing opposite hand on far side of bench.

Execution

Pull head away from pulley cable by laterally flexing neck. Tilt head back toward cable pulley and repeat. Sit on bench the opposite direction and continue with other side.

Comments

Sit at distance away from pulley so weight does not bottom out at lowest range of motion. Keep clinched grip on belt against side of head throughout movement. Woven cotton or cloth belts tend to slip less, particularly on bald heads. If belt slips from head, place small towel between belt and head.

Cable carabiner slips to one side on square buckles and stresses belts structural integrity under heavy loads. Rounded buckle is more ideal since it provides more even stress on belt. Belts not made specifically for weight training may cause injury if they fail under load in which they were not designed.
